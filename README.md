- Real-time temperature, humidity, and weather conditions  
- Responsive UI design  
- Error handling for invalid city names  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

### 🎯 Purpose of This Project

I created this project as a **learning exercise** to get hands-on experience with:
- Fetching real-time data using APIs  
- Working with JSON responses  
- Displaying dynamic data on a web page  
- Building small but functional UI components
